How to get the NFT market report
Some of the sample market metrics are provided below, while the full list of metrics can be found here.

Metric name (in API)	Metric unit	Metric description
marketcap	[currency]	The total market value of the NFT collection calculated as the sum of each NFT valued at the average trading price of the collection.
volume	[currency]	A measure of how much of an NFT collection was traded
sales	count	Number of NFTs sold
traders	count	Number of traders (either buyer and or seller)
washtrade_volume	[currency]	Total trade value suspected of washtrade
holders	Count	Number of traders currently holding NFTs
transfers	Count	Number of NFTs flipped (includes both sale and non sale NFT transfers)
Single metric:
for example, Volume

In this case, all the configuration of the API is managed by query parameters. For example, to obtain a single metric data for a blockchain, by following query parameters

metrics required - metrics sales are passed

currency - USD for US Dollar

blockchain - chain id 1 for Ethereum and 137 for Polygon

time_range - The metric data can be obtained for different time range like 24h, 7d, 30d, and all.

include_washtrade - set True or False to include wash trade

Example:

cURL

curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.unleashnfts.com/api/v1/market/metrics?currency=usd&blockchain=1&metrics=sales&time_range=24h&include_washtrade=true \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'x-api-key: your API key'
From the response, we get the market metrics values for the selected metrics which can be used for further analysis. In Ethereum, we can obtain how much sales have stood from this endpoint.
