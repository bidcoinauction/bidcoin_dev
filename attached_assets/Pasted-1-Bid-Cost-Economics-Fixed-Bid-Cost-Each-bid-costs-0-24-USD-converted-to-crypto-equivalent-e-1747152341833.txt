1. Bid Cost & Economics
Fixed Bid Cost:

Each bid costs $0.24 USD (converted to crypto equivalent, e.g., 0.0001 ETH).

Users purchase bid packs upfront (e.g., 100 bids for $24).

Smart Contract Handling:

Bids are non-refundable and tracked as ERC-20 tokens or in-app credits.

Gas optimization for bulk bid purchases (e.g., approve once, spend bids off-chain).

Why $0.24?

Psychological pricing (feels cheaper than $0.25).

Ensures revenue even if the final item price is low (e.g., 100 bids = 
24

2. Timer Reset Mechanism
Dynamic Countdown:

Base Timer: 10 seconds (adjustable per auction).

Reset Logic:

Every bid restarts the timer to 10 seconds.

Grace Period: If a bid arrives in the last 3 seconds, add +3 seconds (prevents sniping).

Backend Implementation:

Use smart contract events to trigger resets (e.g., emit BidPlaced(timerReset)).

WebSocket pushes to frontend to avoid UI lag.

Behavioral Impact:

"Bid wars" erupt near timer end, driving rapid bid volume.

Users may deploy bid bots to snipe last-moment bids.

3. Price Increment Mechanics
Penny Auction Model:

Each bid increases the item’s displayed price by 
0.01

4. Winning Mechanism
Last-Bidder-Wins:

When the timer hits 0, the last bidder wins at the displayed price.

Smart Contract Steps:

Record winner’s address and final price.

Transfer NFT/fiat item to winner.

Deduct bids used from all participants.

Anti-Cheating Measures:

Front-Running Protection: Randomize block confirmations for last bids.

Bot Throttling: Limit bids from the same wallet/IP in the last 5 seconds.

5. Edge Cases to Address
Low Participation:

If <10 bids are placed, cancel the auction (prevent $0.10 sales).

Gas Wars:

Users may overpay in gas fees to ensure their bid is processed first.

Solution: Use Layer 2 (e.g., Arbitrum) or batch bids.

Disputes:

If the blockchain lags, use oracle verification (e.g., Chainlink) to confirm the true "last bid."

6. Suggested Dev Tasks
Smart Contract:

Implement placeBid() function that:

Resets timer.

Increments price by $0.01.

Emits events for UI sync.

Frontend:

Animated countdown with bid history sidebar.

Pop-up confirmation: "Bid placed! Timer reset to 10s."

Analytics:

Track bid velocity (bids/second) to detect bot activity.

Example Scenario
Item: iPhone (retail $999).

Bids: 1,000 bids placed (
