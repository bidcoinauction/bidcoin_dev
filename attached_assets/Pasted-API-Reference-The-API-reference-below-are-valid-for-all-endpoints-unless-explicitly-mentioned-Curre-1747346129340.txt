API Reference
The API reference below are valid for all endpoints unless explicitly mentioned

Currencies
All currencies values are string-serialized to prevent any rounding issue with any libraries using float values. The
API should always return monetary values in the requested currency (which can be selected by the user), and if their
original currency is different, also return the original value.

Percentages
Percentages are expected to be returned as a ratio (e.g, the percentage divided by 100), where the formatting of
the percentage is done by the client. A percentage of 39.4% is thus returned by the API as 0.394 (39.4 / 100.0).
The API only needs to return the rations with 4 digits of precision (e.g. ratio 0.0001 for 0.01%)

Missing/unavailable data
If data points are requested that are not available, the response is expected to return the key for that data point,
with a value of 'NA' (see MetricValue definition)

Infinity
Some metrics such as change over time metrics can result in either positive or negative infinity. As the JSON
data types don't cater for infinity, we expect the responses to encode positive infinity as 'INF_POS' and
negative infinity as 'INF_NEG'.

Date / Datetime
Date and datetime values are expected to be formatted as a string in ISO 8601 format

Trend time ranges and periods
Trending data that can be requested by the /trend endpoints will return data aggregated to periods, depending on
the requested time frame. These periods are fixed, meaning you cannot ask for 24 hours time range with 1 minute
granularity.

Time range	Parameter	Period of one data point	Number of data points returned
24 hours	24h	1 hour	24
7 days	7d	4 hour	42
30 days	30d	1 day	30
90 days	90d	1 day	90
all	range	1 day	Depends on time_range_start and time_range_end
Metrics
These are descriptions of the metrics that can be requested through the API. Not all metrics are available for all
entities. Which metrics are requestable are documented per API endpoint.

Most of the metrics also have a change metric (called as {metricname}_change). These represent the change
over time of the specific metric as a percentage (positive for rise or negative for decline). It compares the last
full requested time period, to the period of the same length before that. For instance if the time period is 7d (7 days)
it will compare the metric value of the last full 7 days, with the value of the 7 days before that. As it's a
comparison between a previous period, it's not available for the 'all' time range.

Whale
Whales are the wallets that hold NFTs worth $1M. Whales' status will be deprived the moment they lose the worth of the NFTs they are holding. Whales can become normal wallets anytime when they are no longer holding NFTS that is worth $1M.

Shark
Sharks are the wallets that have done wash trading volume of over $1M.

Market state index (marketstate) values
The Market state index provides a high-level score on the state of NFTs sale in a blockchain or an NFT marketplace.

Score	Market activity status
1 - 20	Very low
21 - 40	Low
41 - 60	Moderate
61 - 80	High
81 - 100	Very high
Washtrade level index (washtrade_level) values
This index represents the level of wash trade on the selected blockchain. It is calculated by looking at the percentage of wash trade volume over the non-wash trade volume.

Data points to calculate the index

Volume
Wash Trades
Wash Trade transactions
This index is also available on the Marketplace and on the collection level.

Score	Washtrade activity status
1 - 5	Low
6 - 10	Moderate
11 - 20	High
21 - 35	Very high
